# Sonarmines-VS-Rocks
The ML project is based on the Binary Classification.
The Dataset contains the 208 rows and 61 columns of a bouncing sonar signals of a mettalic cylinder.
The Data set has to scale out so we have used the standard scaler.
then the data set has been explicitly split into two parts with the train test split.
we have used the different visuals to plot the relations between data and it clearly indicates linear regression.
We have used the 5 different algorithms to train the data and accuracy score for the knn classifier is the highest.
